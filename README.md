# Konteks

**Konteks** is a memory engine for AI coding agents.

It builds a project-local context graph through autonomous **knowledge curation**, ensuring you **never re-explain your project** to an AI agent.

Memory artifacts are stored directly inside your repository, exposing compact, task-specific recall through an MCP server without requiring global installation or cloud dependencies.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Zero-Install**: Run anywhere via `npx` or `bunx` without native dependencies.
* **Language-Aware**: Understands code structure across [various file types](src/assets/grammars/registry.json).
* **Local-First**: Your project memory stays in your repo—no cloud, no accounts.
* **Token-Efficient**: High-fidelity context synthesis designed for LLM economy.

## 🧠 How It Works

Konteks treats a repository as a local memory system for agent workflows. It builds searchable project artifacts from source files, retrieves task-relevant evidence, and expands related context through a lightweight graph of entities and relations when available.

## ⚡ Quickstart

Konteks runs on **Node.js (>=22)** or **Bun**. Start by initializing memory from your project root:

```bash
npx -y konteks-cli init
```

Continue with the [Quickstart](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md) for MCP setup and the Warm Up -> Build -> Save flow.

## 📂 Local Storage

Konteks writes local memory under `.konteks/`. It uses SQLite (WASM) for the graph/indexes and a content-addressed object store for payloads. No host SQLite client or native modules are required.
